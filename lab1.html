    <hr>

    <!-- First paragraph -->
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-family: Verdana;">
        The Internet is <span style="color: red; font-size: 20px;"><b>the most important</b></span> 
        means of communication in modern society. It connects millions of people, creating 
        <span style="font-size: 22px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: green;"><i>a new space</i></span> 
        for sharing knowledge and ideas. Its structure is constantly evolving, and technologies 
        are becoming more <u>accessible</u> and diverse.
    </p>

    <!-- Second paragraph -->
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px;">
        <pre>The history of the Internet began in the 1960s.</pre>
        At first, it was used mainly for military and scientific purposes, 
        but over time it became part of everyday life. Today 
        <ins>the Internet</ins> is applied for education, work, entertainment, and trade.  
        The emergence of the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> made it possible to 
        access information quickly from any point in the world.
    </p>

    <!-- Third paragraph -->
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-family: Courier New; color: purple;">
        The Internet plays a role not only in communication but also in the <u>development of the economy</u>, 
        <mark>science</mark>, and culture. E-commerce has become a powerful tool, allowing companies 
        to interact with customers directly. Online education expands access to knowledge, 
        while social networks build unique communities and influence <ins>public opinion</ins>.
    </p>

    <!-- Fourth paragraph -->
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 17px; color: darkred; font-family: Georgia;">
        However, with the growth of the Internet, new challenges arise. Security issues, 
        protection of personal data, and cyber threats have become relevant for every user. 
        An important aspect is the formation of digital literacy, which helps people 
        navigate confidently through the vast flow of information.
    </p>

    <!-- Fifth paragraph -->
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Lucida Console'; color: teal;">
        In the future, the Internet will not just <del>be limited to communication</del> 
        <ins>but will continue to expand</ins>, including virtual and augmented reality, 
        artificial intelligence, and new forms of global cooperation.  
        <!-- This is the conclusion -->
        Thus, the Internet can be considered as a <b>universal platform</b> 
        that changes our world.
